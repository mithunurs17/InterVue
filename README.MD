InterVue — Full Interview Agent

A complete, copy-pasteable project you can open in VS Code. Stack chosen for clarity and fast setup:

## Overview of the Agent

**InterVue** is an intelligent interview preparation agent designed to assist users in practicing, learning, and improving their interview skills. The agent provides interactive mock interview sessions, evaluates responses, and offers feedback to prepare candidates for real-world interviews.

## Features & Limitations

### Features
- Interactive, scenario-based mock interview sessions.
- Real-time feedback and evaluation of answers.
- Customizable interview topics and technical domains.
- Recording and tracking of user progress over sessions.
- Integration with external APIs for up-to-date interview questions.

### Limitations
- Currently supports only a finite set of pre-configured interview topics.
- Feedback may lack deep personalization.
- Does not guarantee job placement or success in actual interviews.
- Best used as a supplement, not a replacement, for human mock interviewers.

## Tech Stack & APIs Used

Backend: Node.js + Express + Socket.io

LLM: OpenAI (uses an API key you provide). Easily replaceable with Claude/Gemini by swapping the API calls.

Database: Supabase (stores interview summaries and metadata). Replaceable with Firebase / Notion / Google Sheets.

Frontend: React (Vite) — plain HTML/JS/React; uses Web Speech API for TTS/STT and getUserMedia for camera check.

Features implemented (minimal, working):

Candidate must allow camera and microphone before interview.

Bot asks role-specific and resume-aware questions (generated by the LLM).

Voice questions via browser TTS; candidate answers via browser speech recognition — transcripts sent to backend.

Backend asks follow-ups (cross-questions) based on answer context and keeps an evolving list of key points.

Interview lasts configurable duration (default 18 minutes).

At the end, backend generates a summary and a pass/fail recommendation and stores it in Supabase.

## Codebase index

- `server/` — Node.js + Express API with Socket.IO transport, interview session orchestration, and Supabase persistence.
  - `server.js` — Express server + socket wiring.
  - `interviewManager.js` — Session model, OpenAI follow-up generation, and recommendation synthesis.
  - `supabaseClient.js` — Thin client factory for Supabase.

## Setup & Run Instructions

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/mithunurs17/InterVue.git
    cd InterVue
    ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
    _or with yarn:_
    ```bash
    yarn install
    ```

3. **Configure environment variables:**  
   Copy the example environment file and modify as needed:
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```
   - Add any required API keys for GPT or question sources.
    
4. **Run the application:**
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    _or, for a development server:_
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

5. **Access the App:**  
   Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.


## Recent UX improvements

- Resume upload now accepts drag-and-drop inspired file input (TXT, DOC, DOCX, PDF) to remove manual pasting.
- Live camera feed stays on throughout the interview; reconnect button will restart the stream if permissions change.
- Bot speaking/listening states animate with hover-responsive pulses so interviewers instantly perceive vocal activity.
- Control surface redesigned with pills, gradients, and transcript chips for quicker operator feedback.


## Potential Improvements

- Broaden the range of topics and domains supported.
- Enhance personalization of interview feedback and scoring.
- Add support for voice- or video-based interviews.
- Integrate with job boards or resume parsing tools.
- Enable multi-language support.
- Allow scheduling of interviews with peers or mentors.
- Improve analytics and reporting of progress.

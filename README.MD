InterVue — Full Interview Agent

A complete, copy-pasteable project you can open in VS Code. Stack chosen for clarity and fast setup:

Backend: Node.js + Express + Socket.io

LLM: OpenAI (uses an API key you provide). Easily replaceable with Claude/Gemini by swapping the API calls.

Database: Supabase (stores interview summaries and metadata). Replaceable with Firebase / Notion / Google Sheets.

Frontend: React (Vite) — plain HTML/JS/React; uses Web Speech API for TTS/STT and getUserMedia for camera check.

Features implemented (minimal, working):

Candidate must allow camera and microphone before interview.

Bot asks role-specific and resume-aware questions (generated by the LLM).

Voice questions via browser TTS; candidate answers via browser speech recognition — transcripts sent to backend.

Backend asks follow-ups (cross-questions) based on answer context and keeps an evolving list of key points.

Interview lasts configurable duration (default 18 minutes).

At the end, backend generates a summary and a pass/fail recommendation and stores it in Supabase.

## Codebase index

- `server/` — Node.js + Express API with Socket.IO transport, interview session orchestration, and Supabase persistence.
  - `server.js` — Express server + socket wiring.
  - `interviewManager.js` — Session model, OpenAI follow-up generation, and recommendation synthesis.
  - `supabaseClient.js` — Thin client factory for Supabase.
- `client/` — Vite React front end.
  - `src/App.jsx` — Landing/onboarding + resume file upload flow.
  - `src/Interview.jsx` — Live interview cockpit, camera feed, hover effects for speech/listening states.
  - `src/styles.css` — Design system, card layouts, hover/speaking/listening animations.

## Recent UX improvements

- Resume upload now accepts drag-and-drop inspired file input (TXT, DOC, DOCX, PDF) to remove manual pasting.
- Live camera feed stays on throughout the interview; reconnect button will restart the stream if permissions change.
- Bot speaking/listening states animate with hover-responsive pulses so interviewers instantly perceive vocal activity.
- Control surface redesigned with pills, gradients, and transcript chips for quicker operator feedback.

InterVue — Full Interview Agent

A complete, copy-pasteable project you can open in VS Code. Stack chosen for clarity and fast setup:

Backend: Node.js + Express + Socket.io

LLM: OpenAI (uses an API key you provide). Easily replaceable with Claude/Gemini by swapping the API calls.

Database: Supabase (stores interview summaries and metadata). Replaceable with Firebase / Notion / Google Sheets.

Frontend: React (Vite) — plain HTML/JS/React; uses Web Speech API for TTS/STT and getUserMedia for camera check.

Features implemented (minimal, working):

Candidate must allow camera and microphone before interview.

Bot asks role-specific and resume-aware questions (generated by the LLM).

Voice questions via browser TTS; candidate answers via browser speech recognition — transcripts sent to backend.

Backend asks follow-ups (cross-questions) based on answer context and keeps an evolving list of key points.

Interview lasts configurable duration (default 18 minutes).

At the end, backend generates a summary and a pass/fail recommendation and stores it in Supabase.
